The program is a kind of benchmark. It started from the 'next_trigger' example
of the distribution, and the equivalent functionality was made for 'wait'.
With the internal repetions count, the test runs through 1000 times the
module's actions.
The main test program creates the requested number of identical objects
starts the simulation. During this several times and the consumed memory is recorded
and printed at the end.

The program measures the setup (elaboration), the simulation and the wall-clock times,
and also records system and user times.
The performance is characterized by MAPS (Million Actions Per Second),
and calculated for the elaboration only, the simulation only, and for all
(from the beginning to the end). The RAM is the increase in RAM due to SystemC actions,
CSw is the number of non-voluntary context switches.

The tex/pdf files show some results derived on the computer with configuration
shown in Configurations.txt

To run the program  provide {NEXT/WAIT}  #repetitions
The program will reply with text like

Method 'next_trigger', times in msec
REPEAT,  Tsetup,  Tsimul,   Twall,   Tuser, Tsystem,  iMAPS,  MAPS,tMAPS, RAM(kb),  CSw,
   100,   1.284,   9.208,   9.208,   9.208,   0.000,77.862,10.860, 9.531,     248,    0,
the lines can be copied to spreadsheet programs, or pasted into the .tex files
producing performance diagrams
(I used to tun 3-5 times the same command line, and select the lowest times.
Several factors can increase the running time, but no one can decrease it,
so the smallest value is the best estimate).

The .tex files make diagram lines from the embedded data
\begin{filecontents*}{SystemC-Perf_Wait_LenovoDebug.txt}
REPEAT,  Tsetup,  Tsimul,   Twall,   Tuser, Tsystem,  MAPS, <MAPS>,     RAM,  CSw,
     1,   0.045,   0.184,   0.184,   0.093,   0.093, 5.431, 4.364, 4873768,    0,
\end{filecontents*}
(The header is only needed once, as shown in the examples)
The procedure is NOT automated, take two arguments and produces just a one-line result.
To get reasonable results, do not run other programs in the background.

The graphs are produced through the commands in the .tex file trough commands
\addplot table [x=REPEAT, y= MAPS, col sep=comma] {SystemC-Perf_Wait_LenovoDebug.txt};
\addlegendentry{$wait$,debug}
i.e. the corresponding file is named, and the two clumn heads.
(Take care: LaTeX DOES use the correspondingly named file in your disk,
and if exists with such a name, and DOES NOT  overwrite it with the contents listed
in the "filecontents" delimiters. You may also prefer to edit those files.
I prefer to keep the data with the diagrammin instructions, but I deleted
the files from the disk when I edited the "filecontents")
